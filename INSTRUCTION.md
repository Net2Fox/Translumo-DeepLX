# Instructions on how to use MORT with DeepLX. 

1. Download the latest version of the original [DeepLX](https://github.com/OwO-Network/DeepLX/releases) and the latest release version of my fork [Translumo-DeepLX](https://github.com/Net2Fox/Translumo-DeepLX/releases).
2. Run DeepLX. Do not close the DeepLX window or it will stop working.
3. Start Translumo. Remember to dismiss all update notifications.
4. Go to the `Languages` tab and in `Translator` select `DeepLX`.
5. Done. Customize Translumo to your liking and use it.
